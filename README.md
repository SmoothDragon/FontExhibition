# FontExhibition
Create a PDF showing of all the fonts installed on a linux system.

## Goal:
I wanted to quickly see all of the fonts installed on my system.

## Caveat:
Many fonts on your system that have not been used will require a fair amount of time to compile.
Future compilations will runs faster.
